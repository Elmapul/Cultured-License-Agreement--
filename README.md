# Cultured-License-Agreement--
an licence to keep our culture alive =D

in order to use this software, you have to record an video of yourself dancing caramelldansen and upload it to youtube, niconico, or any other site with more than 1 million daily active users.
dont explain anything on the video, just DO IT, and send an link to the author of this software as proof that you did it (make sure he can download the video so you cant take it down).

if you are the type of person who never show your face on the internet, its acceptable to use an mask while you do that.

if you dont wan't to dance caramell, hare hare yukai is acceptable as well, just put some effort to it, dont dance as someone who arent even trying to learn how to dance it.
as an alternative you might dance an vocaloid song, or anything that any future versions of this licence recognize as cultured.

if you have some paralysis that prevent you from doing certain kinds of movment, you can ignore that licence.
please do so before i change my mind and ask you to sing instead.


this licence was created as an joke, but if an software developer really attach it to his software... HE MEANS IT! the licence really apply!
